## What is this?

This is an attempt to revive the EnderWeb.

## What was the EnderWeb?

The EnderWeb was a creation of the same mind behind TurtleScripts.com,
da404lewzer. It was a place where everybody could make a site that was
viewable on a ComputerCraft computer, or online at a special site.

### What happened to it?

The server is dead, and I'm too much of a wuss to ask da404lewzer if he
still has anything of it.

## Why do this?

Because I can.

Also, I used to have a few pages. I wanna do that again. It was fun.

## What's with the tagline?

It's an injoke. One user, Zobody, made every all-same-digit page (111111 to
999999) a picture of a dickbutt, with a signature.
