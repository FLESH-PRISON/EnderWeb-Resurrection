 # EnderWeb Resurrection

[EnderWeb.net](WWW.ENDERWEB.NET)

## What is this?

This is an attempt to revive the EnderWeb. Unlike phoenix, this will be a all-in-one solution. It will include Chorus(server), Anvil(page editor), Purpur(Pearl 3.0), and the Website. Im not stopping at just a server but a suite for other server owners to deploy their own. My site with time should be able to host help other people's EnderWeb by allowing them to use the EnderWeb url for their server and configuring it for them.

### What was the EnderWeb?

The EnderWeb was a creation of the same mind behind TurtleScripts.com, da404lewzer. It was a place where everybody could make a site that was viewable on a ComputerCraft computer, or online at a special site.

If your interesting in an actual website, I recommend [NeoCities](https://neocities.org) for a static site or [Rentry](rentry.co) for a site in markdown.

## What happened to it?

The server is dead and da404lewzer seems to have disappeared. I personally messaged da404lewzer on Reddit a few times and got no response. The original enderweb server was tightly linked to TurtleScripts so its not suprising that when it went under that they both disappeared. If you have a massive backup of TurtleScripts (hopefully scripts), please message me at gluttony@vora.city. I also have a special place for it and despise the loss of knowledge.

## The future

### What if history repeats?

Im hosting my site on a [Oracle VPS](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) for cheap. Its only 2.50/month. My server would run until:

A: Oracle shuts down.
B: Oracle abandones Always-Free resources.
C: 180GB of XML are generated. 
D: Chinese bots get ahold of it.
E: I really struggle to make more than $30 a year. Ouch!

### Roadmap

There will be a lot of planning to go ahead of this project to restore it to glory.

#### Stage 1

Pearl 2.0 release - Fix slight bugs and minor improvents. First official fix is preventing a crash if no connection to the server was established and displays the error as a custom page. Very Cool.
Chorus Server - Endereye refactor focusing on dynamic page serving and mongoDB connection for future proofing.
Anvil - Bring back the editor with a live preview. Will bring back Pearl Cast for this.
Crafting Bench - Downloadable Drag'N'Drop page editor with pixel art creator. This will upload too.

#### Stage 2

Not that far yet! The skys the limit though!
